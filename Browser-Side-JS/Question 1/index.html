<!-- 
    This is a reflex based game.

When the user comes to the page, he has 1 second to click the screen. 
If he waits more than 1 second, a message is displayed telling him that he's lost.

Hints
Use an addEventListener on the body element. 

Create an empty div with an id and use it to tell the user whether he won or lost.
